## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Option 1: Production Installation (Recommended for Users)**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mac-battery-limiter.git
   cd mac-battery-limiter
   ```

2. **Build and install:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   cd BatteryLimiter-Standalone
   ./install.sh
   ```

### **Option 2: Development Environment (For Developers/Testing)**
Want to test without installing? Use the development environment:

```bash
./dev_run.sh
```

This runs the app locally for testing without system installation. Perfect for:
- üß™ Testing new features
- üêõ Debugging issues
- üîç Trying before installing
- üöÄ Quick development iterations

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for full development guide.

3. **Grant permissions**: When prompted, allow accessibility permissions for battery monitoring

4. **Access the app**: Look for the battery icon in your menu bar

## üìã Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Intel or Apple Silicon Mac
- Accessibility permissions (required for battery monitoring)

## üîß Manual Installation

If you prefer to build manually:

1. **Build the standalone app**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Install to Applications**
   ```bash
   cd BatteryLimiter-Standalone
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Launch the app**
   ```bash
   ./launch_battery_limiter.sh
   ```

## üì± Usage

### First Run
1. The app will request accessibility permissions
2. Set your preferred maximum charge limit (default: 80%)
3. The app starts monitoring automatically

### Daily Use
- **Menu Bar Access**: Click the battery icon in your menu bar
- **Real-time Updates**: Battery status updates automatically every 2 seconds
- **Automatic Operation**: The app runs in the background and notifies you when limits are reached

### Features
- **Background Monitoring**: Continues working even when not actively used
- **Sleep Mode Support**: Maintains monitoring during system sleep
- **Smart Notifications**: Alerts when charging limits are reached
- **Persistent Settings**: Remembers your preferences across restarts

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

To completely remove Battery Limiter:

1. **From the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd BatteryLimiter-Standalone
   ./uninstall.sh
   ```

2. **Or if you're already in the project root:**
   ```bash
   ./BatteryLimiter-Standalone/uninstall.sh
   ```

The uninstall script will:
- Remove the app from your Applications folder
- Remove the LaunchAgent (so it won't start automatically)
- Clean up all associated files
- Stop the app if it's currently running

## üîí Privacy & Permissions

Battery Limiter requires accessibility permissions to:
- Monitor battery status and charging state
- Provide real-time battery information
- Operate in the background for continuous monitoring

**No personal data is collected or transmitted.** All monitoring is done locally on your Mac.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Framework**: SwiftUI + AppKit
- **Battery Monitoring**: IOKit framework with enhanced error handling
- **Charging Control**: Multi-layered approach for maximum reliability:
  - **Primary**: SMC (System Management Controller) with multiple control methods
  - **Secondary**: Power management commands (pmset) as fallback
  - **Emergency**: Aggressive system-level commands as last resort
- **Background Operation**: LaunchAgent integration with 0.5-second monitoring intervals
- **Command-line build system**: Uses xcodebuild for automated builds
- **Standalone app distribution**: Self-contained installation packages
- **üÜï Enhanced Reliability**: Continuous verification and proactive charging prevention

## üöÄ How Charging Control Works

Battery Limiter uses a **multi-layered approach** to ensure your battery never overcharges:

### **Layer 1: SMC Control (Most Reliable)**
- Direct access to your Mac's System Management Controller
- Multiple SMC methods tried simultaneously for maximum success rate
- Real-time charging current control

### **Layer 2: Power Management Fallback**
- Uses macOS power management commands (`pmset`)
- Automatically activated if SMC control fails
- Compatible with all Mac models

### **Layer 3: Emergency Fallback**
- Aggressive system-level commands as last resort
- Ensures charging limiting works even in extreme cases
- User notification if manual intervention is needed

### **Proactive Prevention**
- Monitors charging every 0.5 seconds for immediate response
- Stops charging 1% before reaching your limit
- Continuous verification that charging has actually stopped

**Result**: Your battery is protected 100% of the time, regardless of Mac model or system configuration.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Menu bar icon not visible**
   - Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility
   - Ensure Battery Limiter is enabled
   - Restart the app if needed

2. **App not starting at login**
   - Check System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items
   - Re-run the installation script

3. **Charging control not working**
   - Ensure the app has accessibility permissions
   - The app now uses multiple fallback methods for maximum compatibility
   - If SMC control fails, power management commands will be used automatically
   - Emergency fallbacks ensure charging limiting works even in edge cases
   - Check console logs for detailed information about which methods succeeded

### Getting Help

- Check the app's built-in help and settings
- Review the console logs for error messages
- Open an issue on GitHub with detailed information
