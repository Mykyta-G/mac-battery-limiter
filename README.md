# Battery Limiter

A macOS application that helps preserve your MacBook's battery health by monitoring battery status and providing insights into battery health. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Battery Charging Control is NOT Possible on Modern Macs**

**This app CANNOT stop charging or set charge limits** due to Apple's security restrictions. It provides battery monitoring and health insights instead.

## üîç Current Status: Research Complete

**We have thoroughly investigated battery charging control on modern Macs and found it to be fundamentally impossible:**

### **What We Tested:**
- ‚úÖ **SMC Access**: Successfully connected to System Management Controller
- ‚ùå **Battery Keys**: **NO battery control keys exist** on macOS 15.6+
- ‚ùå **Write Capability**: Keys cannot be created or modified
- ‚ùå **Charging Control**: **Zero software methods available**

### **Why It's Impossible:**
1. **Apple Removed the Keys**: Battery control SMC keys don't exist anymore
2. **No Software Interface**: macOS provides no commands for charging control
3. **Firmware Lockdown**: Charging circuits are controlled by locked firmware
4. **Security Design**: Apple intentionally removed this functionality

These tools proved that even with full administrative access, battery charging control is impossible on modern macOS.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Battery Monitoring**: Real-time battery level and charging status
- **Battery Health Insights**: Information about battery condition and cycle count
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Easy access via the battery icon in your menu bar
- **Background Operation**: Continues monitoring even when the app is not actively used
- **Sleep Mode Support**: Maintains monitoring during system sleep with reduced frequency
- **Automatic Startup**: Launches automatically when you boot your Mac

- **üÜï System Insights**: Shows what battery control methods are available on your Mac
- **üÜï Polished UI/UX**: Clean, modern interface with optimal spacing and layout for the best user experience

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Option 1: Production Installation (Recommended for Users)**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mac-battery-limiter.git
   cd mac-battery-limiter
   ```

2. **Build and install:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   cd BatteryLimiter-Standalone
   ./install.sh
   ```

### **Option 2: Development Environment (For Developers/Testing)**
Want to test without installing? Use the development environment:

```bash
./dev_run.sh
```

This runs the app locally for testing without system installation. Perfect for:
- üß™ Testing new features
- üêõ Debugging issues
- üîç Trying before installing
- üöÄ Quick development iterations

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for full development guide.

3. **Grant permissions**: When prompted, allow accessibility permissions for battery monitoring

4. **Access the app**: Look for the battery icon in your menu bar

## üìã Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Intel or Apple Silicon Mac
- Accessibility permissions (required for battery monitoring)

## üîß Manual Installation

If you prefer to build manually:

1. **Build the standalone app**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Install to Applications**
   ```bash
   cd BatteryLimiter-Standalone
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Launch the app**
   ```bash
   ./launch_battery_limiter.sh
   ```

## üì± Usage

### First Run
1. The app will request accessibility permissions
2. Set your preferred maximum charge limit (default: 80%)
3. The app starts monitoring automatically

### Daily Use
- **Menu Bar Access**: Click the battery icon in your menu bar
- **Real-time Updates**: Battery status updates automatically every 2 seconds
- **Automatic Operation**: The app runs in the background and notifies you when limits are reached

### Features
- **Background Monitoring**: Continues working even when not actively used
- **Sleep Mode Support**: Maintains monitoring during system sleep
- **Battery Health Notifications**: Alerts about battery status and health
- **System Compatibility Info**: Shows what's possible on your specific Mac

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

To completely remove Battery Limiter:

1. **From the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd BatteryLimiter-Standalone
   ./uninstall.sh
   ```

2. **Or if you're already in the project root:**
   ```bash
   ./BatteryLimiter-Standalone/uninstall.sh
   ```

The uninstall script will:
- Remove the app from your Applications folder
- Remove the LaunchAgent (so it won't start automatically)
- Clean up all associated files
- Stop the app if it's currently running

## üîí Privacy & Permissions

Battery Limiter requires accessibility permissions to:
- Monitor battery status and charging state
- Provide real-time battery information
- Operate in the background for continuous monitoring

**No personal data is collected or transmitted.** All monitoring is done locally on your Mac.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Framework**: SwiftUI + AppKit
- **Battery Monitoring**: IOKit framework with enhanced error handling
- **System Detection**: Automatic macOS version and architecture detection
- **Compatibility Analysis**: Determines what battery control methods are available
- **Background Operation**: LaunchAgent integration with monitoring intervals
- **Command-line build system**: Uses xcodebuild for automated builds
- **Standalone app distribution**: Self-contained installation packages
- **üÜï Enhanced Monitoring**: Comprehensive battery status and health information

## üö´ Why Battery Charging Control is Impossible

**Battery Limiter cannot stop charging or set charge limits** due to fundamental limitations in modern macOS:

### **üîí Apple's Security Restrictions**
- **No Software Interface**: macOS provides no commands to control battery charging
- **SMC Lockdown**: System Management Controller keys for battery control are removed
- **Firmware Control**: Charging circuits are controlled by locked firmware, not software
- **Security Design**: Apple intentionally removed charging control to prevent malicious apps

### **üì± What This Means for Your Mac**
- **Intel Macs**: Even with SMC access, battery control keys don't exist on macOS 15.6+
- **Apple Silicon**: No SMC support for battery control at all
- **All Macs**: Charging control is completely locked down by Apple

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Menu bar icon not visible**
   - Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility
   - Ensure Battery Limiter is enabled
   - Restart the app if needed

2. **App not starting at login**
   - Check System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items
   - Re-run the installation script

3. **App shows limited functionality**
   - This is expected - battery charging control is not possible on modern Macs
   - The app focuses on monitoring and providing battery health insights
   - Check the system compatibility information in the app
   - All Macs have these limitations due to Apple's security restrictions

### Getting Help

- Check the app's built-in help and settings
- Review the console logs for error messages
- Open an issue on GitHub with detailed information
